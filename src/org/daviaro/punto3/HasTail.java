 * The interface body can contain abstract methods, default methods, and static methods. 
 * An abstract method within an interface is followed by a semicolon, but no braces (an abstract method does not contain an implementation). 
 * Default methods are defined with the default modifier, and static methods with the static keyword. All abstract, default, 
 * and static methods in an interface are implicitly public, so you can omit the public modifier.
